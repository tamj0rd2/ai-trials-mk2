# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This project uses ADRs to document all significant architectural and technology decisions. ADRs are **mandatory** and must be respected throughout development.

All current ADRs are documented in the `/docs/architectural-decisions/` folder. **Always check the files in this folder before making architectural decisions** to ensure compliance with existing choices.

We will use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to create new ADRs or supercede existing ADRs.

You do not need to scan previous ADRs for format and structure. The `adr` binary will create a new skeleton document with the required headings.

## Creating a new ADR

To write a new ADR, execute a command like `adr new <new adr name>`
- where `<new adr name>` is the name of the ADR we want to write

## Superceding an ADR

Execute a command like: `adr new -s <id> <new adr name>` 

- where `<id>` is an ADR number without the leading zeros.
- where `<new adr name>` is the name of the ADR we want to write

Superceding an ADR will mark the superceded ADR as such. You don't need to manually edit it.

## What Requires an ADR?

ADRs are for significant decisions that affect multiple developers or the long-term structure of the project. They document decisions about core technologies, architectural patterns, and constraints that impact multiple areas of the system.

## ADR Authority

- Implementation must align: All code must follow the patterns and technologies documented in ADRs
- Check ADRs first: Before making any architectural decisions, review existing ADRs
- Adhere to architectural decisions: All implementation must align with documented architectural decisions
- No new technologies without ADRs: Any new framework, or technology must be documented in an ADR before fully adopting it
- ADRs can be superceded: ADRs are not final, they can always be superceded if we need to revise our decision.
- ADRs shouldn't be approved without an evaluation period: We need to evaluate whether the decision works for us before approving it. Until the evaluation is complete, the ADR status should be "Proposed". While any ADR has the status "Proposed", you should remind the user at the end of your output.
- Don't assume you know how to fill out the ADR: Writing an ADR should be done through a discussion. You need to get feedback from the user.

## Writing style

- Avoid repetition - don't repeat the same point in multiple bullets
- Respect reader's time - eliminate fluff and redundant explanations
- Scannable format - use short paragraphs and clear headings
